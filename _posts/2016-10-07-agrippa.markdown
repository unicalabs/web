Agrippa is a PHP-based secret sharing mechanism. Named after the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrippa_(A_Book_of_the_Dead)">William Gibson</a>, Agrippa operates on the principle that sharing a temporary link to sensitive information is better than having the sensitive information itself persist in email, chat, or any other insecure communications channel.

<h4 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h4>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Enter the secret to share, an expiration date/time, and a view limit.</li>
    <li>Receive a unique link to the secret, which can be shared with the intended recipient.</li>
    <li>Once the link expires or the view limit is surpassed, the secret is destroyed.</li>
  </ol>
